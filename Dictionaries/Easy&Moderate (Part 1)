### Basic Dictionary Operations:

Create a dictionary with the keys name, age, and city, and assign values to them.
Print each key-value pair using a loop.

abc = { 'Name' : 'Mathana', 'Age': 30, 'City': 'Singapore'}

for x in abc:
  print(x, ":", abc[x])


### Counting Characters:

Write a program to count the frequency of each character in a given string and store it in a dictionary.

Name = input("Please input a String: ")
asd = dict()

for x in Name:
  asd[x] = asd.get(x, 0) + 1
#print(asd)


### Dictionaries and Files:

Write a program to read a text file and count the number of occurrences of each word.
Store the results in a dictionary and print it.


fhand = open('input.txt')
words = dict()

for line in fhand:
  line = line.rstrip()
  tyu = line.split()
  for word in tyu:
    words[word] = words.get(word,0) + 1
print(words)


### Using get() in a Dictionary:

Write a program to count the frequency of numbers in a list using a dictionary. Use the get() method to handle missing keys.


numbers = [1,2,2,7,3,3,4,5,5,5,5,5]

dic_count = dict()

for number in numbers:
  dic_count[number] = dic_count.get(number,0) + 1
print(dic_count)

### Word Frequency Counter:

### Looping Through Dictionaries:

Write a program to create a dictionary with student names as keys and their marks as values. Print each studentâ€™s name and their marks.

Scores = {'Mary' : 100, 'Sam' : 90, 'Jack' : 95, 'Bob':75, 'Tim': 70}

for x in Scores:
  print("Student:", x,',', "Score:", Scores[x])
