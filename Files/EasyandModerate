##### Easy

### Opening and Reading a File:

Write a program to open a file named example.txt and print its content line by line

fhand = open("example.txt")

for line in fhand:
  line = line.rstrip()
  print(line)
  
  
### Using Try/Except:

Write a program that attempts to open a file specified by the user. If the file does not
exist, display an error message using try and except.
  
  
  file_name = input("Please provide a file name: ")

try:
  fhand = open(file_name)
except:
  print("You have provided an invalid file name")
  exit()


### Writing to a File

Write a program to create a file named output.txt and write the following text into it:

Hello, World!

Welcome to file handling in Python.


fout = open('example.txt','w')

Wrote the above text in example.txt


### Counting Lines:

Write a program to count the number of lines in a file named data.txt


fhand = open('example.txt')

count = 0

for line in fhand:
  count = count + 1
print("There are", count, "lines in example.txt")


##### Moderate

### Searching Through a File:

Write a program to search for a specific keyword (entered by the user) in a file and
print all the lines that contain the keyword.

abc = input("Please provide a keyword to search in example.txt: ")

fhand = open('example.txt')

for line in fhand:
  if line.find(abc) == -1:
    continue
  print(line)


### Appending to a File:

Write a program to append the following text to an existing file named log.txt:
Log Entry: File updated successfully.


fhand = open('log.txt', 'a')

L = "Log Entry: File updated successfully."

fhand.write(L)


### Reading and Writing Combined:

Write a program to read a file input.txt, convert all the lines to uppercase, and save
the result in output.txt.


fhand = open('input.txt')
i = 0
abc = []
for line in fhand:
  line=line.upper()
  abc.append(line.rstrip())
  
  i += 1
#print(abc)
fgh = " ".join(abc)

fhand_new = open('output.txt','w')
fhand_new.write(fgh)


### Using Try/Except with File Operations:

Write a program to safely read a file. If the file doesn't exist or can't be opened, print
an appropriate error message. If the file is read successfully, count the number of
words in it.


try:
  fhand = open('output.txt')

except:
  print("The file cannot not be opened or does not exist")

jkl = []

for line in fhand:
  #print(line)
  line = line.split(" ")
  #print("Debug", line)
  jkl.append(len(line))
  #print("Debug", jkl)
print("The total number of words in the file is", sum(jkl))
