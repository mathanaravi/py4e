(Combining Lists and Strings)
### Write a program to read a sentence from the user, split it into words, and join the words back into a sentence with each word capitalized

x = input("Please enter a Sentence: ")
y = x.split()
z= []

for abc in y:
  xyz = abc.capitalize()
  #print(xyz)
  z.append(xyz)
#print(z)
print(" ".join(z))


(Object and Values)
### Create a list of lists. Modify one sublist and demonstrate that only that sublist is affected, not the others

a = [1,2,3]
b = [4,5,6]
c = [7,8,9]
j = [a,b,c]
print("Before modifying list a: ",j)
del a[1]
print("List a after modification: ", a)
print ("After modifying list a: ",j)


(List Comprehensions)
### Write a program to create a list of squares of even numbers from 1 to 20 using list comprehension

mny = []
abc = []
i=0
for x in range(2,22,2):
  mny.append(x)
print(mny)
for y in mny:
    z = y*2
    abc.append(z)
print(abc)
