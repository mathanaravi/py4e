Easy

1. Basic Pattern Matching:

Write a program to check if a string contains the word "Python" using a regular
expression.

import re

fhand = open('LearnthePython.txt')
for line in fhand:
  line = line.rstrip()
  if re.search('.*Python.*', line) :
    print("This line contains Python: ", line)
	
2. Character Matching:

Write a program to find all vowels in a string using a regular expression.

import re
fhand = open('FindtheVowels.txt')
for line in fhand:
  line = line.rstrip()
  if re.search('[aeiouAEIOU]', line) :
    print("This line contains vowels: ", line)
	
3. Escape Characters:

Write a program to search for the literal string \n in a given text using a regular expression.


4. Extracting Numbers:

Write a program to extract all the numbers from the string "The price is 45 dollars, and the discount is 10%".

import re

abc = "The price is 45 dollars, and the discount is 10%"

y = re.findall('[0-9.]+', abc)
print("The numbers in the string are", y[0],"and", y[1])
