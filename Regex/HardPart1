# Hard

# 1. Complex Pattern Matching:

Write a program to validate strings against the pattern AB123XY, where:
  ▪ AB is any two uppercase letters.
  ▪ 123 is a three-digit number.
  ▪ XY is any two lowercase letters.

import re

fhand = open('stringnames.txt')

for line in fhand:
  line=line.rstrip()
  y = re.findall('[A-Z][A-Z]\d\d\d[a-z][a-z]',line)
  if len(y) > 0:
    print(y)

# 2. Password Validation: (need to edit)

Write a program to validate passwords using the following rules:
▪ At least 8 characters long.
▪ Contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit.
▪ Includes at least one special character (@, #, $, etc.).

import re
import string

fhand = open('stringnames.txt')

for line in fhand:
  line=line.rstrip()
  if len(line) >= 8 and re.search('\d+', line):
      print("The password is invalid as it only contains numbers:", line)
  elif len(line) >= 8 and re.search('[a-z]+', line):
      print("The password is invalid as it only contains lowercase letters:", line)
  elif len(line) >= 8 and line in string.punctuation:
      print("The password is invalid as it only special characters:", line)
  elif len(line) >= 8 and re.search('[\S][\S][\S][\S][\S][\S][\S][\S]', line):
      print("The password is valid:", line)
  elif len(line) < 8:  
    print("Password is too short:", line)
	


3. Log File Parsing:

Write a program to parse a log file and extract all IP addresses using a regular expression.

import re

fhand = open('IPaddresses.txt')

for line in fhand:
  line=line.rstrip()
  y = re.findall('\d\d\d\.\d\d\d\.\d\d\d\.\d\d\d' ,line)
  if len(y) > 0:
    print(y)
	

4. Extracting Subdomains:

Write a program to extract subdomains from a list of URLs. Example: Input:
['https://sub.example.com', 'http://blog.website.org'] Output: ['sub', 'blog']

import re
hand = open('mbox-short.txt')

abc = list()

for line in hand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    y = re.findall('https://(\S+)\.\S+\.[a-z][a-z][a-z]',line)
    if len(y) > 0:
      #print(y)
      abc.extend(y)
print(abc)


5. Debugging Regular Expression Code:

Debug and fix the following code:
import re
text = "The numbers are 12.34, 56.78, and 90."
result = re.find("d+.d+", text) # Should extract ['12.34', '56.78']
print(result)

My answer,

result = re.findall("\d+\.\d+", text)
